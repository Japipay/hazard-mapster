        <h2 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin-bottom: 1rem;">About the Website</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--text-dark); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
           This website provides a comprehensive Hazard Map of Zamboanga City, encompassing all 98 barangays within the city. It systematically presents information on prevalent natural hazards, including flooding, landslides, earthquakes, and coastal-related risks, allowing users to identify potential threats specific to each barangay. The platform is designed with a clear and structured layout to ensure accessibility, accuracy, and ease of understanding for all users.
        <p style="color: var(--text-dark); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
           In addition, the website includes barangay-specific emergency hotline numbers to support timely communication and response during disaster situations. Its primary purpose is to enhance public awareness, disaster preparedness, and risk reduction by centralizing critical hazard and emergency information in a single, reliable source. Through this platform, residents, stakeholders, and visitors are better equipped to make informed decisions and respond effectively to natural hazards in Zamboanga City.
